Registers
---

This folder contains verilog code for n bit register and register file ( b x w )(using parameters). To instantiate a register of size say 15 bit use
the syntax, ```register_nbit#(15) instantiation_name(...)``` and ```register_file #(b,w) instantiation_name(...) ```where b is the no: of bits in a register and w is the no: of registers
in a register file.
