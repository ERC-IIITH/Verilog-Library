This folder contains various types of adders in 3 different modelling styles. Namely they are, Behavioural, GateLevel(Structural), Dataflow modelling.

Each file in a follows the naming convention b_module.v, g_module.v , d_module.v each modelled in Behavioural, Gatelevel , Dataflow respectively.

The testbenches for each folder tests all the modellings implement and follows the naming scheme module_tb.v .

All the modules are succesfully simulated using Intel Quartus Prime and ModelSim-Altera. 

TODO
-[ ] Carry select adder to be implemented in Dataflow and Behavioural Modelling
-[ ] 64 bit implementations of the following.
